                                    In this era of Internet and digitization, we’ve moved from phone to VoIP calls, face-to-face meeting to video conferencing, fax to email, cable television to IP TV, and the list goes on.
                                </p>
                            </div>  
                            <div ng-show="selectedState=='How Do I Acquire Bitcoins?'">
                             <p style="font-size:20px;"> There are various ways to get Bitcoins:

                                <li style="font-size:20px;">‘Mining’
                                    <li style="font-size:20px;">Currency exchange (bitcoin in return for Dollars or Euros) via bitcoin provider services like Mt.Gox
                                        <li style="font-size:20px;">Providing services to others in return of Bitcoins
                                        </p>
                                    </div> 
                                    <div ng-show="selectedState=='How to transfer Bitcoins'">
                                      <p style="font-size:20px;">  To send bitcoins, you need two things: a bitcoin address and a private key. A bitcoin address is generated randomly, and is simply a sequence of letters and numbers. The private key is another sequence of letters and numbers, but unlike your bitcoin address, this is kept secret.

                                        Think of your bitcoin address as a safe deposit box with a glass front. Everyone knows what is in it, but only the private key can unlock it to take things out or put things in.

                                        When Alice wants to send bitcoins to Bob, she uses her private key to sign a message with the input (the source transaction(s) of the coins), amount, and output (Bob’s address).

                                        She then sends them from her bitcoin wallet out to the wider bitcoin network. From there, bitcoin miners verify the transaction, putting it into a transaction block and eventually solving it.</p>
                                    </div> 
                                    <div ng-show="selectedState=='What are the uses of Bitcoin'">
                                      <p style="font-size:20px;"> 
                                         <h4>It’s fast<h4>

                                            When you pay a cheque from another bank into your bank, the bank will often hold that money for several days, because it can’t trust that the funds are really available. Similarly, international wire transfers can take a relatively long time. Bitcoin transactions, however, are generally far faster.

                                            <h4>It’s cheap</h4>
                                            <h4>There are no chargebacks</h4></h4>
                                            <h4>People can’t steal your payment information from merchants</h4>
                                            <h4>You own it</h4>

                                            <h4>You can create your own money</h4></p>
                                        </div> 
                                        <div ng-show="selectedState=='Who Developed The Idea Of Bitcoins?'">
                                         <p style="font-size:20px;">   The concept of Bitcoins was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto, who resides in total anonymity. He is said to be from Japan but his mail ID was from Germany, plus the bitcoin software was not available in Japanese. He developed the system and the Bitcoin software (that is used to run the system) in 2009 but disappeared into thin air in 2010.

                                            The other developers of the system stopped hearing from him in 2010, and plenty of speculation turned up about his real identity. Some even suggested that his name was just a mashup of popular Japanese companies — SAmsung TOSHIba NAKAmichi MOTOrola. But what he created was definitely the fantasy of every tech guy in the world.</p>
                                        </div> 
                                        <div ng-show="selectedState=='What Is So Special About the Bitcoin System?'">
                                          <p style="font-size:20px;">  The Bitcoin is a system which allows you to do anonymous currency transactions and no one will come to know about the payment or about all other info related to the payment, including who sent it, who received it, etc.

                                            Satoshi did it by making the system – a peer-to-peer network – controlled by no central authority but run by a network of contributors and freedom enthusiasts, who donated their time and energy to this innovation. Essentially, people can do money transactions and no authority or organization will come to know about it.

                                            Satoshi Nakamoto was so talented that he even solved the problem of double spending of digital currency in his system.</p>
                                        </div> 
                                        <div ng-show="selectedState=='What is Double Spending?'">
                                            <p style="font-size:20px;">People can make many copies of digital data, e.g. people copy software and sell it as counterfeit or pirated copies. We may face the same problem with digital currency – one can copy the digital currency (let’s suppose USD10) and use it as many time as he/she like (as many notes of USD10).

                                                Satoshi solved this problem by showing all transactions in a public list. Whenever a new transaction is made, its validity is checked by confirming from the list that the digital currency was not used before. This way, no one can copy the currency and use it for more than one time. It’s a simple but effective idea to stop double spending of the same bitcoin.</p>
                                            </div> 
                                            <div ng-show="selectedState=='How do you use Bitcoins?'">
                                             <p style="font-size:20px;">  Bitcoins are kept in a digital wallet which you can keep in your computer, or on a website online, which will manage and secure your wallet for you. You can have as many wallets and bitcoin addresses (where you receive money from others) as you like.

                                                What’s more, you can use Bitcoin software on top of Tor to prevent anyone from tracking your IP address – total anonymity guaranteed!</p>
                                            </div>   
                                            <div ng-show="selectedState=='What is Bitcoin Mining?'">
                                                <p style="font-size:20px;">    Mining is a process of extracting Bitcoins currency. Bitcoin mining is a business – most people mint Bitcoins to gain profit. Bitcoins are minted using a special software (known as Bitcoin Miner) which tries to find a new block in the chain of Bitcoin network.

                                                    bitcoin miner
                                                    Whenever a new block is found, its owner is gifted with 50 Bitcoins. Technically, a computer has to perform long and tough hash calculations to find a new block</p>
                                                </div> 
                                                <div ng-show="selectedState=='How Do You Spend A Bitcoin?'">
                                                   <p style="font-size:20px;">     Spending Bitcoins is a bit easier. You can send Bitcoins to a person, buy goods, or donate to non-profit foundations who accept it, such as Wikileaks, P2P Foundation, Operation Anonymous, Free Software Foundation, Archive.org.

                                                    You can send Bitcoins to anyone once you know their bitcoin address.

                                                    For merchandise, you can buy products from merchants that accept Bitcoins. Example – BitcoinDeals.</p>
                                                </div> 
                                                <div ng-show="selectedState=='What about Bitcoin and taxes?'">
                                                   <p style="font-size:20px;">     Bitcoin is not a fiat currency with legal tender status in any jurisdiction, but often tax liability accrues regardless of the medium used. There is a wide variety of legislation in many different jurisdictions which could cause income, sales, payroll, capital gains, or some other form of tax liability to arise with Bitcoin.</p>
                                               </div> 
                                               <div ng-show="selectedState=='Who is Satoshi Nakomoto?'">
                                                  <p style="font-size:20px;">      That is a question that, until now, nobody has been able to answer. Bitcoin’s founder and original developer chose anonymity, but that is not as suspicious as it sounds. Bitcoin and its payments system, the blockchain, have the potential to disrupt the global banking and payments systems as well as reducing the power that governments hold over their subjects. Whether it fulfills that potential is yet to be seen, but it isn't hard to imagine that the founder envisaged making some very powerful enemies. Given that, anonymity looks like a sensible precaution.

                                                  <p style="font-size:20px;">     The blockchain is a decentralized network of all Bitcoin users that essentially checks and records every transaction. When you download the Bitcoin client software it connects via the internet to every other user and generates a pair of mathematically linked codes or keys. One of those keys is public and the other private. When you transfer payments in Bitcoin the software checks one against the other to verify that you have verified Bitcoin to make the payment, then logs the transaction in a record available to all users. Every legitimate Bitcoin can therefore be traced back to its original miner
